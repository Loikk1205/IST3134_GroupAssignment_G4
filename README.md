<h1>Group 4 - IST3134 Big Data Analytics in Cloud</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hi, we are from Assignment Group 4 of IST3134. Our group consist of two people, Loi Kuan Kit and Lee Sze Jie. This GitHub Repository will bring you through our codes when undergoing analysis using the prepare dataset. 
Browsing through the repository would provide you insights on the ways MapReduce and Spark analysis are done through the use of <b>Python Programming Language</b>.</p>

<h2>Our Project</h2>
<p>ðŸ“– Our project uses a dataset downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/flight-delay-dataset-20182022). This project provides the results and understanding through the use of Python MapReduce, and Spark to perform analysis such as the 
frequency of airline companies that experience flight delays. The analysis would solely be performed using AWS EC2 instances.</p>
